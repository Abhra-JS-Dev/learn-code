# 🎯 Your First Python App: Number Guessing Game

Welcome to your first Python application! This interactive number guessing game is designed to teach you fundamental Python programming concepts through hands-on coding.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Make sure Python 3.6+ is installed on your system
2. Open your terminal/command prompt
3. Navigate to this directory
4. Run the game:
   ```bash
   python3 guessing_game.py
   ```
   or on Windows:
   ```bash
   python guessing_game.py
   ```

## 🎮 How to Play

1. The computer thinks of a random number between 1 and 100
2. Choose your difficulty level (Easy, Medium, or Hard)
3. Try to guess the number within the given attempts
4. Get helpful hints along the way!
5. Win by guessing correctly or learn from your mistakes

## 📚 Python Concepts You'll Learn

This game demonstrates these essential Python concepts:

### 🔤 **Variables and Data Types**
- Integers (`secret_number`, `attempts_used`)
- Strings (`difficulty`, `choice`)
- Lists (`guesses_made`)
- Booleans (`game_won`)

### 🔧 **Functions**
- Function definition with `def`
- Parameters and return values
- Docstrings for documentation

### 🔄 **Control Flow**
- `if`, `elif`, `else` statements
- `while` loops for game logic
- `break` to exit loops

### 📥📤 **Input/Output**
- `input()` for user interaction
- `print()` for displaying information
- F-strings for formatted output

### 🎲 **Modules and Imports**
- `random` module for number generation
- `sys` module for system operations

### ⚠️ **Error Handling**
- `try`/`except` blocks
- Handling `ValueError` exceptions
- Input validation

### 🧮 **Built-in Functions**
- `int()` for type conversion
- `abs()` for absolute values
- `len()` for list length
- `map()` and `join()` for string operations

## 🛠️ Code Structure

The app is organized into clear, reusable functions:

- `display_welcome()` - Shows the game introduction
- `get_difficulty_level()` - Handles difficulty selection
- `get_player_guess()` - Gets and validates user input
- `give_hint()` - Provides smart hints to players
- `play_game()` - Contains the main game logic
- `play_again()` - Asks if user wants another round
- `main()` - Orchestrates the entire application

## 🎯 Learning Tips

1. **Read the comments** - The code is heavily commented to explain each concept
2. **Experiment** - Try modifying the number range or adding new features
3. **Break things** - Don't be afraid to change code and see what happens
4. **Practice** - Run the game multiple times to see different scenarios

## 🚀 Next Steps

Once you're comfortable with this app, try these challenges:

1. Add more difficulty levels
2. Include a high score system
3. Add sound effects or colors
4. Create a graphical version with tkinter
5. Make it multiplayer
